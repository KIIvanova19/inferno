							<p>The water tank usually contains hundreds of gallons of water which is the main water source used by the firefighters to help extinguish the fire. They keep using this to create a powerful stream of water until they are able to connect to a fire hydrant which is water connection point that helps them tap into another water supply. Needless to say, fire hydrants are a very vital part of active fire protection.</p>

							<p>The main distinguishing factor that separates the truck from the engine is that the former is the actual rig with a big ladder. This is what gives fire trucks their true distinction. It is specialized equipment that is called out for structure fires and similar situations that require extra manpower and emergency firefighting gear.</p>
